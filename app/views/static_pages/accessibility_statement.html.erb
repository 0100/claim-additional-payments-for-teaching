      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non accessible content</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        issues with the school search Accessible Autocomplete plugin
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The school search plugin, Accessible Autocomplete has no associated label. The text input used to search for schools
      does not have an associated label so when a user navigates to it, depending on the software used the question may
      not be announced. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships), 1.3.5 (identity
      input purpose), 2.4.6 (headings and labels), 3.3.2 (labels or instructions), and 4.1.2 (name, role, value).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The school search plugin, Accessible Autocomplete has incorrectly formatted autocompletes within it. When users of
      the software JAWS search for a school they do not hear an announcement of the number of search results. This does
      not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.5 (identity input purpose) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We plan to amend the Accessible Autocomplete plugin when an update is released. We expect this to be before
      December 2020.
