## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.2
- PostgreSQL

## Setting up the app in development

1. Run `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies
2. Run `bundle exec rails db:setup` to set up the database development
3. Run `bundle exec rails server` to launch the app on http://localhost:3000

### DfE Sign In credentials

By default in development OmniAuth will run in test mode. This means that you 
don't need to authenticate with DfE Sign In. If you need to run development with 
integration with DfE Sign In, you need to provide the relevant environment
variables.
 
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```
DFE_SIGN_IN_ISSUER=https://pp-oidc.signin.education.gov.uk:443
DFE_SIGN_IN_REDIRECT_URL=https://localhost:3000/auth/callback
DFE_SIGN_IN_IDENTIFIER=<paste identifier>
DFE_SIGN_IN_SECRET=<paste secret>
```

The identifier and secret are stored in Heroku.

## Running specs, brakeman, and code linting

```bundle exec rake```

### Code linting rules

Using the standardrb gem:

### N+1 query detection

[Bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) runs around each spec. If it detects an N+1 query it will raise an
exception and the tests will fail.
